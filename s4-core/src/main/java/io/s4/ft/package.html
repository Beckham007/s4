	<p>This package contains classes for providing some fault tolerance
		to S4 PEs.</p>
	<p>The current approach is based on checkpointing.</p>
	<p>Checkpoints are taken periodically (configurable by time or
		frequency of application events), and when restarting an S4 platform,
		saved checkpoints are automatically and lazily restored.</p>
	<p>Lazy restoration is triggered by an application event to a PE
		that has not yet been restored.</p>
	<p>
		The application programmer must take care of marking as <i>transient</i>
		the fields that do not have to be persisted.
	<p>Storage backends are pluggable and we provide some default
		implementations in this package</p>
